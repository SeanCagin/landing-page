            Here we have a queen. It is the most powerful piece in chess. It can do anything!
            Well... almost anything! It is around the enemy king a lot more than her own king which 
            raises a few eyebrows...

          <p class="description">
            Here we have a horse. Well not exactly. In chess, this piece is known as a knight. It has
            the unique ability to "jump" over pieces. The knight is without a doubt the most interesting
            piece in chess and it is also the trickiest. It has caused so much pain and pleasure throughout
            the history of chess.

          <p class="description">
            Here is a bishop. It is a weaker queen. The queen combines the bishop's and rook's abilites. The
            bishop's ability is to move diagonally. It is often a very good long range fighter and has led to
            many many low elo checkmates on the g7 square when teamed up with the queen.

            I was going to put a rook for the last piece since it is the only one left (other than a pawn (yawn)). 
            However, I came across this thing when I was scrolling for images and I found it quite interesting.
            I am not exactly sure what it is or why knights are so obsessed with him but perhaps it a leak from the
            upcoming chess update!
